**Project Name**: Be-A-Millionaire

**Description**:  
"Be-A-Millionaire" is a quiz-based game inspired by the popular TV show from the early 2000s. This interactive platform offers players the chance to test their knowledge and win money by answering a series of questions. It features a simple user interface starting with a **login page**, where returning users can sign in, and new users can register. During registration, a one-time fee of **D200** is required, payable through a mobile money app - WAVE, APS, Afrimoney or Yonna.

Once registered, players can jump into the game and answer timed questions, with **30 seconds** allocated per question. For every correct answer, they win **D100** and move on to the next question, progressing toward the ultimate goal of earning substantial rewards. "Be-A-Millionaire" combines the thrill of competition with the simplicity of mobile payments, providing an engaging experience where knowledge directly translates into winnings.
